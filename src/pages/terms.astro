                <h3>1. Booking Confirmation</h3>
                <p>
                    A booking is considered confirmed only after you receive a
                    confirmation message via WhatsApp or Email from our official
                    channels.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Cancellations and Refunds</h3>
                <p>
                    You may cancel your booking up to 24 hours before the
                    scheduled pickup time for a full refund. Cancellations made
                    within 24 hours may be subject to a cancellation fee.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Flight Delays</h3>
                <p>
                    We monitor flights for delays. However, if your flight
                    number changes or is cancelled, you must inform us
                    immediately to reschedule your pickup.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Luggage Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    Passengers are responsible for ensuring their luggage fits
                    within the capacity of the booked vehicle. If you have
                    excess luggage, please book a larger vehicle (e.g., GMC or
                    Hiace) to avoid inconvenience.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Passenger Conduct</h3>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who poses a
                    threat to the safety of our drivers or vehicles. Smoking is
                    strictly prohibited in all our vehicles.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Changes to Terms</h3>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time.
                    Continued use of our service constitutes acceptance of the
                    new terms.
